# Restuarant Orders

Let’s come back to the restaurant recommender. The restaurant managers gave feedback that they were looking for additional functionality to filter orders so they can highlight their specials on the app.

We’re going to build on top of the previous project to filter orders instead of restaurants. The restaurant managers want to surface dishes that fit within the customer’s budget and show the cost of each dish. The program will use array methods, functions, and practice good code hygiene and organization. Let’s work on it step by step and enjoy some chicken and waffles at the end!
